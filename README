Cryptocat Verifier is a Chrome extension that does client-side integrity verification of the client-side cryptosystem Cryptocat uses to encrypt your messages. By installing this extension, your Cryptocat sessions are protected against JavaScript poisoning attacks.

Cryptocat Verifier works by comparing crypto.cat's JavaScript to the JavaScript files posted on GitHub.
