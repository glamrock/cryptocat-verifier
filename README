Cryptocat lets you set up encrypted, private chats for impromptu secure conversations. Check it out at https://crypto.cat.

Cryptocat Verifier is a Chrome extension that does client-side integrity verification of the client-side cryptosystem Cryptocat uses to encrypt your messages. By installing this extension, your Cryptocat sessions are protected against JavaScript poisoning attacks.

Cryptocat Verifier works by comparing crypto.cat's cryptosystem to the latest Github version and by analyzing Cryptocat's chat page.
